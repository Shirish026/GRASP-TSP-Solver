# GRASP Algorithm for TSP

This repository contains an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm constructs a solution by iteratively building a tour and then refining it using local search techniques.

## Description

The GRASP algorithm is designed to find near-optimal solutions for the TSP, a well-known NP-hard problem. This implementation follows a two-phase process:
1. **Construction Phase**: A greedy solution is generated by iteratively selecting the nearest unvisited city.
2. **Local Search Phase**: The solution is improved by applying a stochastic two-opt swap, which attempts to reduce the total distance of the tour.

## Key Features

- **Constructive Heuristic**: Generates a feasible solution by considering the nearest neighbor strategy.
- **Local Search**: Utilizes the stochastic two-opt method to refine the solution.
- **Dynamic Stopping Criteria**: The algorithm stops when a specified number of iterations are completed without improvement.

## Dependencies

The implementation uses the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and distance calculations.
- `bokeh`: For visualizing the TSP tour.
- `random`: For generating stochastic components in the algorithm.

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy bokeh
```
## Usage

To run the GRASP algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), follow the steps below:

1. **Set Parameters**:
   - `max_iterations`: The maximum number of iterations to run the GRASP algorithm.
   - `patience`: The number of iterations without improvement before the algorithm stops.

2. **Run the Algorithm**:
   - Execute the GRASP algorithm using the provided code in the Jupyter Notebook (`Grasp_new.ipynb`).

   Example:

   ```python
   max_iterations = 1000
   patience = 50

   start_time = time.time()
   best_tour, best_cost = grasp(coordinates, max_iterations, patience)
   end_time = time.time()

   plot_tour_bokeh(best_tour, coordinates)
   print(f"Best cost found: {best_cost}")
   print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

3. **Visualize the Results**:

The plot_tour_bokeh function will generate an interactive plot of the best tour found. This plot is displayed directly in the notebook.

4. **Analyze the Output**:

The best tour's total cost and the algorithm's execution time will be printed in the console.
